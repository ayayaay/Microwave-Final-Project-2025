About
This repository provides a detailed guide and documentation for completing the 01205322 Microwave Engineering Final Project: Tapered Transmission Line, conducted in the second semester of the 2025 academic year.

This work is the final project for the 01205322 Microwave Engineering course offered by Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand. The project covers the complete process of designing, fabricating, and testing a tapered transmission line, with both theoretical analysis and practical implementation.

This repository is dedicated in honor of Professor David M. Pozar, author of Microwave Engineering, and Professor Denchai Worasawate, the lecturer of the 01205322 Microwave Engineering course at Kasetsart University.

Proj.son is the Sonnet geometry file
TaperBH10.son is the the Sonnet netlist file
Ratchaphon.s2p is the actual tested performance of the Tapered Line, it can be opened using Sonnet as well
